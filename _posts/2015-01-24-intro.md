title: Coding Journey, an Introduction
---

Two months ago, I quit my job as a Media Manager to pursue a new career as a front-end web developer. I've since decided that it would be beneficial to keep a coding journal where I could publish my understandings as a means for future reference and potentially help others on a coding journey like myself. The web is an invaluable resource to me during this learning process, so hopefully these records will be of use to someone.

The following is a short list of some of my observations/advice from my journey thus far:

* Accept that you don’t (have to) know everything. Being able to search for something is more important than memorizing minutiae.
* Don’t be overwhelmed with frustration, it’s your brain trying to learn. Take a walk or a nap and let your brain make the neural connections.
* Learning to code is like scaling a steep mountain. Your consistent effort compounds, so don’t lose momentum. Code every day.
* Everything you do, for better or worse, you do for yourself. Be accountable for your actions. Create a rigid schedule, and be mindful about time sinks like binge-watching videos unless it’s related to what you’re learning.
* Make things that you would like to use.
* The feeling of finishing a project that you dreamed up from start to end is so rewarding.
* Exercise, go outside, do social human things.
